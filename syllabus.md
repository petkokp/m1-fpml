Required Prior Knowledge:
- (T1A, Applied Stats): Maximum Likelihood Estimate and related notions
- (T1B, Maths for DS): Basic Linear Algebra, well mastered (tensor product, diagonalization)
- python, numpy.
Ideally, too:
- (OPT9, Hands On ML): it’s a good complement to this class, very good to master sklearn. Here we’ll look inside the algos of sklearn or others.
+ Check out previous years exam to see the level of math-mastery that is expected (of course some of it is covered in this course, but you need good basics).

This course is algorithms-oriented, i.e. we will sketch the great principles of ML at first, and then focus on how algorithms work in practice, including all necessary mathematical aspects.
They are the basic building blocks of more advanced algorithms.


Planning (content):
1 Gradient Descent, Linear Regression from scratch
2 Classification with a single layer Perceptron, from scratch. Geometrical interpretation, a word on SGD/mini-batch learning. Discussion on the choice of the loss function, or activation functions. OVR multi-class scheme (quickly)
3 overfitting, train/validation/test split, K-fold CV, regularization: in general, L2, L1.
4 MAP, Bayesian interpretation of Ridge Regression or Lasso one.
5 feature maps ("Kernel trick"), PCA (from scratch, seen as variance maximization), PCA as pre-processing (dimensional reduction)
6 Kernels, Kernelized perceptron, SVM in the separable case (some details omitted). Exercise: Lasso regularization from scratch (pseudo-gradients quickly introduced)


Acquired Skills:
- Know the basics of ML vocabulary
- Make good habits, understand the standard pipeline
- Know a couple of standard (supervised, shallow-ML) algorithms (be able to write their pseudo-code, explain their functioning)
- Be able to code an algo (implement the training function) by reading its doc (documentation ≃ book chapter)

--------------

We are moving to 6 sessions per quarter. The courses must therefore be reorganized accordingly. Continuous assessment can take place outside these 6 weeks, but ensure that the students are available, which is particularly complex in Q6 since the week before Christmas is reserved for a project that almost all students undertake.

Please provide a few keywords that will be useful for the teachers who follow you to know what they can build on.
